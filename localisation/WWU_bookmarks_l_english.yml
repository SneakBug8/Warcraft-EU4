 THE_SCOURGE_DESC: "Ner'zhul, the warchief of the failed Old Horde, was punished by Kil'jaeden the Deceiver for failing to subjugate the humans. As punishment, Ner'zhul's body was destroyed, and his mind was encased in a suit of armor bound to the Frozen Throne, and thrown towards Azeroth where it smashed into Northrend, residing near the top of Icecrown Glacier. And thus the Lich King was born, and the Plague of Undeath was sent to Lordaeron."
