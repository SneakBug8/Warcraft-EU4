 wwu_runic.1.title: "Runts!"
 wwu_runic.1.desc: "The Vrykul race has long been afflicted by the Curse of Flesh, and seemingly vrykul offspring exhibit an unusual mutation thanks to this. These children are born small and weak, and unfit to be warriors. King Ymiron traditionally persecuted these runts, insisting they be killed lest the vrykul race be dminished by them. However, perhaps these 'humans' as they are often called could be used in other ways."
 wwu_runic.1.option.a: "Persecute them, it is the only way"
 wwu_runic.1.option.b: "Tolerate them, perhaps they will contribute eventually"
