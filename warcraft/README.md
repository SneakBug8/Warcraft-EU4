Warcraft is an unique take of the World of Warcraft universe, adapted to work in EU4. 

# Overview
- Detailed map that is inspired by the World of Warcraft map.
- Lots and lots of different nations, split into different races and religions, providing an assortment of different playstyles.
- Unique ideagroups, government reforms, etc, all tailored to fit into Warcraft.
- Adapted features such as the Tauren Federation, which makes use of the HRE mechanics to provide an unique clan system for the Taurens.
- Support for the Orcish Invasion, the Alliance of Lordaeron, the Scourge and the Battle of Hyjal as major events that will occur during a playthrough.

# FAQ
### Why are province and area names generic?
- Naming over 5000 provinces uniquely with most locations requiring novel naming means it will take time to complete. I'd rather release the mod and allow people to play it than making them wait for something that is basically functionally aesthetic. Important provinces and those that match existing locations from World of Warcraft will be named.

### Why is the text appearing oddly?
- The mod only supports English localization, so if you are playing EU4 is a different language, you'll need to switch the English to see the actual text.
