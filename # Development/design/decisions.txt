Whew, that was nuts, wasn't it? All those human kingdoms, each having their own unique decisions. Not to mention I'll be overhauling their National Ideas later! Jebus, that was a lot of work and research. Anyways, now on to something WAY easier; the Magic nations of the Eastern Kingdoms. Only two of them!
(Kharazan, Dalaran)

That's the Magical groups done. Now we move on. Almost done, now! Now we have the three Dragonflights that actually have a foothold in the Eastern Kingdoms. They all have a shared "Draconic" decision tree, except for the Black Dragonflight, who also get their own. Of course, if my above suggestions are accepted, the land owned in the Eastern Kingdoms will belong to minor dragon factions, who will just use the default "Dragon Decisions".
(Red Dragonflight, Black Dragonflight, Green Dragonflight)

    Dragon Base Decisions
    Honor the Titans (Changs Religion to Titanic, -1 Unrest, +2% Missionary Strength)
    Path of Druidism (Changes Religion to Druidism, +1% Missionary Strength)
    Path of Corruption (Changes Religion to Old Gods, +1 Unrest, +5% Manpower Recovery)
    Pact of Protection (Relations bonus with all neighbors, -1 Unrest)
    Pact of Annexation (Relations decrease with all neighbors, -5 Years of Seperatism)
    Pact of Neutrality (-2 Unrest)
    Call a Dragonsmeet (Relations bonus with all dragons, +20% Tax Modifier for 20 years, reuseable every 30)

    Black Dragonflight Decisions

    Create the Twilight Cult (+2 Unrest, +3 Missionary Strength)

I'm not too happy with the Dragons. I feel that the other Dragonflights should have unique decisions too, but I'll figure that our when we do Northrend. For now, let's move on. Only one large group left, everyone's favorite mountain-dwellers, Dwarves!
(Dark Iron, Thorium Brotherhood, Ironforge, Wildhammer)

    Base Dwarven Decisions
    Unite the Three Clans (Own Blackrock Mountain, Grim Batol, Aerie Peak, Ironforge, Empire Rank Dwarven Empire Tagswitch)

Wooo! Almost done. Just a few more, and we're finished. Next up Are the Troggs. For the life of me, I couldn't think of anything super good for them, but I at least thought of a two decisions.
(Stonevault, Stonesplinter, Irondeep)

    Trogg Base Decisions
    Allow Plundering (+10% Tax Modifier, +0.5 Tax Income)
    Deny Plundering (+2 Unrest, -25% Stability Cost, +5% Production Efficiency)

Next are the Titans. Jebus hell, I could be here for hours just making decisions for them, but I cut myself off at 5. I have plenty more ideas, though, but I don't think we should pour TOO much in them.
(Uldaman)

    Titan Keeper Base Decisions

    Allow Corruption Magic (Changes Religion to Old Gods, +1 Unrest, +10% Tax Modifier)

    Foster Dwarven Alliances (100 Ducat Cost, Relationship bonus with Ironforge, Reuseable every 10 years)


And that's it. All of the Eastern Kingdom. Every last single nation gone over, given special, unique decisions fitting of their race. Holy hell, this was a lot of work, and we only have one-fourth of the continents done! Anyways, I'm just glad to help, and look forward to seeing if any of this makes it in. Balance, of course, is all up to the Devs; if they want to modify or change any of these, they of course are allowed to!
